# XamarinFormsGestureRecognizerDelaySample

i've created a sample project with xamarin forms,
simply it has a frame and a GestureRecognizers in it to receive tapped command which will shows tapped count of taps on a label.

when you try to click/tap so fast the the number which shown on label will be different with actual count of your taps.
here is our problem, it seems to be a delay between taps
