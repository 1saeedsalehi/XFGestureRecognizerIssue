# XamarinFormsGestureRecognizerDelaySample

I've created a sample project with xamarin forms,
simply it has a frame and a GestureRecognizers to receive tap event, and a label which shows tapped count on it.

When you try to click/tap so frequent the the number which shown on label will be different with actual count of your taps.
It seems android is working fine, but uwp is failing to behave correctly.
