# XamarinFormsGestureRecognizerDelaySample

i've created a sample project with xamarin forms,
simply it has a frame and a GestureRecognizers in it to receive tapped command, and a label which will shows tapped count on a label.

when you try to click/tap so frequent the the number which shown on label will be different with actual count of your taps.
here is our problem, it seems to be a delay between taps
